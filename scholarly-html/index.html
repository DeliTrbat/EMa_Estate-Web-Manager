    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>


    <section id="11-purpose">
      <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or
        release
        number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only
        part
        of
        the system or a single subsystem.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="12-doc-conventions">
      <h3>1.2 Document Conventions </h3>
      <p>
        any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or
        highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities for higher-level requirements
        are
        assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own
        priority.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="13-int-audience">
      <h3>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
      <p>Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers,
        marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how
        it
        is
        organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding
        through
        the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="14-product-scope">
      <h3>1.4 Product Scope</h3>
      <p>Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits,
        objectives,
        and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope
        document
        is
        available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="15-references">

      <h3>1.5 References</h3>
      <p>List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style
        guides,
        contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document.
        Provide
        enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version
        number,
        date, and source or location.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="2-overall-description">
    <h2>Overall Description</h2>

    <section id="21-product-perspective">
      <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this
        product
        is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained
        product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the
        functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major
        components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="22-product-functions">
      <h3>2.2 Product Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in
        Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make
        them
        understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they
        relate,
        such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="23-usr-classes">
      <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated
        based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels,
        educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain
        requirements
        may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from
        those
        who are less important to satisfy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="24-operating-env">
      <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system
        and
        versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="25-design-implementation-constr">
      <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include:
        corporate
        or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other
        applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language
        requirements;
        communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if
        the
        customer's organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="26-usr-documentation">
      <h3>2.6 User Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be
        delivered
        along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="27-assumptions-dependencies">
      <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These
        could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or
        operating
        environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared,
        or
        change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you
        intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision
        and
        scope document or the project plan).
      </p>

  <section id="3-external-interface-req">
    <h2>External Interface Requirements</h2>

    <section id="31-user-interfaces">
      <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may
        include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen
        layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard
        shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user
        interface
        is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface
        specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="32-hardware-interfaces">
      <h3>3.2 Hardware interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the
        hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and
        control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="33-software-interfaces">
      <h3>3.3 Software interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version),
        including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the
        data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the
        services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application
        programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data
        sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a
        multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="34-communications interfaces">
      <h3>3.4 Communications interfaces</h3>
      <p>

    <h2>System Features</h2>
    <section id="41-system-feature-1">
      <h3> 4.1 System Feature 1 </h3>
      <p>
        Don't really say "System Feature 1." State the feature name in just a few words. 4.1.1 Description and Priority
        Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You
        could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on
        a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9). 4.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences List the sequences of user
        actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the
        dialog elements associated with use cases. 4.1.3 Functional Requirements Itemize the detailed functional
        requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for
        the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product
        should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete,
        unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not
        yet available.

        Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.
